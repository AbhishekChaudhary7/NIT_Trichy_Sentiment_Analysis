0,This is the best college one could get into NITT,"College Infrastructure
This is 800 acres campus the largest among all NIT's not to brag this is the best college I could get into. There are so many facilities in NIT Trichy, There are so many hostels for boys and girls with various types of rooms. The institution has a modern central library. Our institution also have a sports complex that has all kinds of indoor and outdoor sports. The wifi in our hostel rooms is very fast and there are various food messes for different people and its completely hygienic there.
Academics
I opted Instrumentation and Control Engineering shortly termed as ICE here which is basically a Circuital and non-circuital branch, which is also the main reason I opted this course because I can have exposure to both the sectors. This course mainly deals with the controlling of Sensory machines and Jobs like controlling engineer is perfectly suitable. The faculty working here are highly qualified and they teach really great although a bit strict though. the curriculum is perfectly updated here
Placements
Our branch has high percentage of placed students from past 7 years. There are many MNC's and startup coming from various sectors and offering various types of jobs through our placement cell. not only my branch every brach has average of 90-95% of placed students and highest is 42 LPA from CSE department. the average salary packages differ for department but in common it will be around 9-12 LPA, The process is so easy for placements cause placement cell will be guiding you and it is supportive
Value-for-money
As of first year the fee structure is bit high compared to remaining years So considering all expenses in mind it will be like 1.4 Lakhs in first semester but from them the fees will be like 75-80,000 as I was in my home because of COVID for two years I did'nt need to pay my hostel fee so It is reduced compared to above figures. Off course I feel worth for this money because compared to private Institutions and other NIT's this is relatively less and I have a great campus, excellent education.
Campus Life
Its really good because college life is best as a teenager and here in NIT-T you have various types of entertaining, technical clubs where you can develop your knowledge and Improve your social skills. There is Pragyan and other cultural fests which are one of the biggest events in India so you'll definitely. The support staff is so polite and helps you in knowing about their local langauge. Yes it is safe because we have hospital in case of emergency and people here also so kind you can be good
Anything Else
as I almost told everything in the above lines there isn't much to add but this is The best college I can get into in my life cause I overcame my fears with what I have learnt from here and there are many good activities one can do either sports or academical. SO, I would recommend anyone to join in my college if they have a better score in JEE .

1,Life in Nit Trichy,"College Infrastructure
The infrastructure is too good for a student who come here by completing their schooling in iit academies like sri chaitanya,narayana etc., The campus is wide and vast and you need to have a bicycle to roam inside the campus. Hostels are quiet good with 2 or 3 members per room. Sanitization is good. Wifi is available in hostels. All the hostel blocks and academic buildings are well built. Some of them are old but still pretty enough to be.
Academics
I am doing my graduation in Instrumentation and control Engineering which is a tough subject with tough faculty and with little bit of difficulty in terms of gaining good grades. The teaching is not bad , although self learning is the path i chose mostly. I am gonna go through my placements next year
Placements

Academics
I was the students of mtech at industrial safety engineering . I am from an old batch 2008 . At that time according to that conditions teacher was very updated they make us understand each and evey topic and prepare us for entrance job .
Placements
When i was there placement was not a priority for college. At that time college more focus on practical knowledge and theories knowledge but some of my batch mate had selected on private limited company and students moreover focus on government they start preparing for government they not even sit on the placement interview soo competition was soo less at that.
Value-for-money
Fee was soo feasible for me and even for my batch mate and we can pay fee in installments through cash and there are no of scholarship on the basis of number and annual income and ranks also.
Campus Life
Campus Life is amazing here. You have a your own beach which you can go anytime you want (except during night time when there are high tides). But, never go for swimming in the water as chances of drowning is very high in those waters. We have amazing seniors to help, two fests, one ENGINEER (technical fest), and the other INCIDENT (cultural fest). INCIDENT is the best fest overall as it is the second largest fest in whole of South India after IIT Bombay's MOOD INDIGO.

NIT-t has a lot of great facilities, especially the octagon computer lab and the library. The labs in my department were quite old though and could use an upgrade. Sports facilities are quite good and athletics can be pursued.
Academics
I studied instrumentation and control engineering due to the flexibility of career paths and an interest in robotics. The curriculum definitely needs an upgrade and there should be a lot more hands-on labs and projects to teach students concepts.
Placements
Placements are generally good at NIT-T due to the high caliber of the student body. The highest package offered was for a CS student and I think it was 75 lpa. I choose to go for higher studies, but my classmates who sat for placements all got good packages. The college is supportive and seniors are helpful.

11,A good college that still has room for improvement.,"College Infrastructure
NIT-Trichy is gifted with excellent infrastructure buttressed by modern facilities and equipment. The WiFi provided by the hostel is reasonably fast, but speed fluctuations are more frequent than expected. Laboratories are well equipped with modern facilities. The central library is filled with oodles of books spanning various subjects, catering to the diverse interests of the students.
Academics
My department boasts of experienced and accomplished faculty, and from what I have heard from my friends in other departments, the same holds for them too. Teachers can only act as catalysts in our learning endeavour and only with an effort from our side, can we reap the fruits of the lectures. So, it comes as no surprise that much of our learning takes place outside the confines of the classroom. The subjects are updated regularly incorporating the recent developments in the different fields.
Placements
NIT-Trichy lives up to the expectations when it comes to placements. I, being in the second year, haven't gone through the placement process myself, but the placement statistics' of the senior batches have been encouraging. In 2019, 96.2% of B.Tech students who applied for placements got placed, and the average package was 6.25 lakh.

13,NITT a review.,"College Infrastructure
The infrastructure of the college is really good as compared to other colleges . The library and sports centres are huge and spacious. The hostels and campus is fully eco friendly and prohibits the use of power vehicles inside the campus. Food is hygienic and of good quality. Hostels have Wi-Fi but there are no separate washrooms for each room. Maintenance of the common washroom, is a 4 on 5 and there maintain cleanliness in the corridors as well.
Academics
NIT Trichy academic is great because of its appropriate faculty and updated curriculum. I have been studying chemical engineering since 2 years now and I feel that I have taken a wise decision by joining the college. if we talk about placements the placements are considerable as compared to other colleges, although they depend a lot on what field you have taken ,they are definitely up to the mark.
Placements
Placement have always been of great importance in college and they have always been successful and satisfying the desired of the students so far. Percentage of placement is always greater than 92 and the highest salary has been up to 50 lakh per annum where is the median has reached approximately 8.5 lakhs per annum.
Value-for-money
The first year fees have been a bit high then what people will expect from a government college although they provide you with all the facilities and appropriate learning facilities which makes the fees worth it
Campus Life
The campus life at NIT Trichy is amazing. it is a 800 acre widespread campus which has each and every facilities for the students to entertain themselves as well as make an optimistic and productive environment around themselves . safety measures have always been there for girls which come in the form of restrictions and prohibitions to enter certain areas of the college which are primarily meant for girls students.
Anything Else
An overview you will definitely be positive for NIT Trichy . admisson in the college will only be through JEE mains marks and ranks. Its great if you get a score that make u eligible for the same.

14,NIT TRICHY EXPERIENCE,"College Infrastructure
I don't like the campus that much. The reason is it's not well planned. Each building is at a large distance from the other.The campus also lacks greenery.It doesn't have a single green ground. Though the campus has many small halls but doesn't have a single air conditioned auditorium with a capacity of 3000-4000 people. Talking about the classrooms, their are two complexes in which classes happen. But only few rooms have air conditioning facility and rooms in old complex are like that of school
Academics
Academics here are mostly similar to that of Tier-1 college . In the first year syllabus is mostly same irrespective of departments. But you have to study courses that you will feel like useless and are not related to your field. Also the college provieds opportunity to students to do a minor in any course from any department 2nd year onwards. Though almost all the profs are experienced but teaching style of most of them is boring. So the students mostly learn by themselves.
Placements
As I am still in first year, I don't know exact figures about placements but as I have heard,the placements are really good every year with most of students getting placed. Though the percentage of placements is above 85 for all departments, packages do vary. The CSE department students gets high packages in good number as compared to other,followed by ECE. Average package generally goes around 7-8 lpa ,highest being 40-45 lpa.
Value-for-money
The fees for a general category student is around 2 lakhs for each year including mess and hostel fees. With decent services being provided, I think it is worth it . The mess and hostel fee is minimal justifying the food quality and hostel premises.
Campus Life
It mainly depend on you how you want to enjoy your college life. The college has many extra-curricular and technical societies which regularly participate in national level competition. College also conducts a lot of fests annually , The frontrunner being PRAGYAN and FESTEMBER. The college campus is located on the outskirts,22-23 km from the city , so you are kinda disconnected. But due to good local transport ,buses run to and from the city throughout the day. So you can Hangout on weekends.

ECE. Curriculum is well updated. U can pass, just by studying a night before. Though you don't get the branch u need, you will have option of choosing electives in third year and study the subject you are interested in.
Placements
Sorry. I'm in first year. I have no idea about placements. They should be pretty good for the effort put in. And your placement is all about how you develop yourself in these four years buddy. Nothing much to be done by college.
Value-for-money
Around 2 lakh. Its completely worthy. Same facilities in a private college might cost you more. All the canteens, cafes and other eateries have reasonable rates. This would be really a great option if you have financial burdens.
Campus Life
Just awesome. Stone benches, CCD, lassi shop, D3 dhaba, not costly, but so damn good. Need not worry about emergencies, there is a 24/7 hospital with a back up ambulance. You will also be getting medical insurance from college for further treatment if needed.
Anything Else
Just come her brother/sister who ever is reading it. IITs are full of nerds. NITT has people who are intelligent as well as talented. U wanna enjoy, come here. Language isn't a barrier. You will find many people speaking Hindi.

16,Keep expectations limited,"College Infrastructure
The buildings are quite decent. The old buildings are still well maintained. Cleanliness is maintained throughout, and provides an healthy ambience. The hostel WiFi sucks almost all the time and the gym could use a renovation
Academics
As an chemical engineer, I've learnt from my seniors that the course and it's application are two distinct aspects courtesy to the curriculum. The teaching staff is decent but don't expect them to be very good or helpful
Placements
As a first year, I don't really have much to add here except the fact that our department has witnessed an appreciable streak of 100% placement for the last 3 years. However the rule that once you get an offer, you're no longer allowed in further participation in other interviews is quite a pain.

17,Nit Trichy,"College Infrastructure
Nit Trichy being an institute of national importance is having the best infrastructure, equipment in abundance with no doubt. The facilities of laboratories can be used by any student irrespective of the branch by taking permission from H.O.D of concerned department by showing a report of ur project. And the faculty might even help for your project. There are wide range of opportunities for a student let it be the sports or clubs.The food is hygienic and it also depends on the caterers.
Academics
I'm pursuing my graduation focussed on civil engineering. As it's my own interest towards the development of the nation in terms of infrastructure and usually I'm a person who likes to spend time outside rather than in air conditioned rooms. The curriculum is upto date which will be keep changing for every 2 years by the Board of Studies(BoS)comprising one alumus and professors from I.I.Ts The curriculum is upto date but they will teach you from the scratch so that you are aware of everything.
Placements
The placements of the college are actually good when compared to other colleges of the same department. Nearly 90%of students get placed in every branch. The highest package was 49 lakh till now.It was offered for Production department in a I.T. Company.In civil department the highest package was 17 lakh per an um.And the average package is 5lpa.The placement process is easy and the college guides you through the entire process of placement.
Value-for-money
The annual tuition fee would be nearly 1,70,000INR irrespective of the department you choose.And it varies year to year.And there is reimbursement of tuition fee whose family annual income is less than 500000 per year. And you will be having many scholarships available after getting into the college. I feel I am getting my moneys worth in the form of best staff, student friendly curriculum , smart classes, utilisation of labs in afternoons. Being a part of the team's and clubs in the college.
Campus Life
One of the best things you can enjoy in the college is campus life that a student never gets in any other college. It's the biggest college in south India with huge campus area of 800+ acres. The college have many places to visit.You will be exposed to many fests and the culture of various students coming from all the states of the country even from various countries. It's located in the heart of Tamil Nadu on the banks of River Kaveri.The campus is safe to live and have a hot humid climate.

18,"Good campus, great colleagues, marvelous life.","College Infrastructure
Our campus provides most of the necessary facilities like, sports pitches for different sports, a magnificent library, Octagon Computer center which is open 24X7. The laboratories in Mechanical engineering department are filled with several equipment. The hostel WiFi slows down during peak hours most of the times. Otherwise it is just fine. The living places are cleaned up frequently. But they are not as hygienic as they should be. Even the food messes aren't very hygienic.
Academics
I'm doing Mechanical engineering because I've been passionate about it since my teenage started. The curriculum needs more update. For eg, in Automobile engineering we still study technology that hasn't been in the industry for the past 10-15 years. We need to know about Electric vehicle technology, Artificial intelligence, etc. But our faculty are forced to move out of curriculum and take extra hours to help us learn these. A lot of efforts outside curriculum are required to make us job-ready.
Placements
The Training and Placement office of NIT Trichy does an excellent job in bringing down several companies for each domain. The procedure is systematic. 90% of the students sitting for placements from mechanical engineering get placed generally. Highest salary package was around 60 lpa to a Computer Science student. Average salary for mechanical engineering companies is 6 lpa. Overall, 10-15 lpa. The process involves a lot of steps and takes a week per company on an average.
Value-for-money
The course costs Rs. 99,000 per semester, which is 2 lakhs per year. This includes mess, academic, hostel fees. The expenditure is not so high here. I do feel we are getting our money's worth, when compared to other engineering colleges in India. The competition among the top-notch students helps everyone studying there, pushing us to work hard. The faculty aren't too bad either. Placements are almost guaranteed. The Letters of Recommendation from profs here are totally worth it.
Campus Life
Campus is huge. It feels to lonely at times due to the forest-y appearance. The best thing here is the presence of around 50 technical clubs and as many non-technical clubs as well. We improve our personality being in college fest teams too. We find no student who doesn't engage in any of them. The location is not good. The campus is 25 km away from the city. Safety has been a huge issue here, especially women safety.
Anything Else
If not for a few issues like safety, curriculum, rules, etc this college maintains what it takes to be among the top engineering colleges in India.

20,Best place to enjoy your youth life in a diverse place,"College Infrastructure
It is one of the the top 5 college in India in terms of infrastructure. It is beside has lot of high tech equipments. The food they provide are very hygienic and gives us lot of mess options,which we can change each month. The only drawback here is wifi,the speed is very slow. If your room is close to router,it is heaven for you.The libraries and sports center are excellent and provide good services. Laboratories are open all time and you can access all the equipments with the staffs.
Academics
The process are very well in terms of knowledge,but in terms of delivering they are not so. They have to improve their teaching skills rater that doing research.The professors are not partial and gives space to each student's. The curriculum is very much updated and very well designed.Unlike other colleges class hours is very less,which gives students to explore their talent in their own field
Placements
Once a student gets admission in NITT,he/she bound to get a good job,which will bring a sense of joy and satisfaction after working hard for 4 years.NITT makes sure that hardworking student doesn't go empty handed and disappointed,with plenty of companies from diverse background offering jobs.I will proudly tell the placement rate is 100% and many will go for highers as well. average salary will be around 8-9LPA.The placement is a easy process,the effort we put won't go priceless.
Value-for-money
The cost we pay for this institute is very less compared to other NIT's. Even IIT's are paying more fees than others.You will get all the benifits like hospital,insuranse if any medical issues, quality mess food,sports center, libraries and we'll packed laboratories.It also gives various free access for students like MS-Office,Notion etc.
Campus Life
It is best to explore in and out of campus. There is no restrictions for male students. You can roam around with your friends for night walk or movie.The location of college is in village side,so it takes around 1hour to go to city,which is a drawback. But because of its interior location,it gives us radiation less and diverse environment. We have hospitals,provision stores inside which is accest 24/7. The place is very hot,which makes difficult to survive in summer. The cycle is must in campus.
Anything Else
I took to purse chemical engineering just for sake and not because of interest.I want to purse my career in the field of Mathematics, but I wasn't able to get it into after my failure in JEE. I took this course just because of the brand 'NITT',which gives me base opportunity to explore my academic life as well as student life. This brand gives me a identity which other private institute can't offer.Thats the reason why I choose NITT, even when I got offer good branches from other institute.

Though NIT is under the MHRD for nationally recognised institution. If you don't have any reservation the fees is somewhat high. The tution fees per sem is around 70000 INR and hostel and mess fees around 35000INR. For the money paid the facilities are average but surely not a waste. If your family income is above 5lakh and you are from general category you have to pay somewhat premium fees.

The campus stretches to about 800 acres. Being one of the largest campuses in India. It has a lot of clubs making students engaged and it's near to National Highway with airport and railway station within 30Km.

It's a miniature India where you can find people from almost all places . Even from other countries.

32,One of the best among the best colleges.,"College Infrastructure
Well the infrastructure majorly depends on what branch are you from. For example, the mechanical branch uses a pretty old building but cse,ece,eee,ice uses new infrastructure. You can enjoy the campus to the fullest but there are certain areas where boys and girls are not allowed respectively. The campus is around 800 acres most of which is unused but the climate of trichy is very humid so sometimes it's hotter than one could expect. The library is huge with almost everything you need.
Academics
Like any other college here too there is vagueness in the teaching quality. But it's pretty obvious that one might find mathematics more interesting than environmental science right? Some professors are really good while others are not so good. But once you enter in 2ndsemester here you hardly depend on any professors. And that's a very good thing but you will realise it only when you experience it. The curriculum is not so updated yet but as of now HOD's are trying their best to bring in new cu
Placements
I can not emphasize on this more ""placements depends on the quality of students and the work placement committee of your college puts in"". And place-com of nit-trichy is in top-10 in india which includes even the IIMs. Coming to average packages, cse is the Highest with around 20+lpa and overall it's around 7-8lpa. And percentage of students placed too again depends majorly on students themselves because there are around 200 companies visiting the campus every year.
Value-for-money
The fees depends upon your category. Like for sc st the tuition fee is totally free. You can check anything related to this on the official website anytime or even on websites like careers360. Coming to the worth of money, the mess food generally is unlimited and it's better than one would expect. I know that's hard to believe but if you choose the right mess you'll get almost home cooked food. The hostels are very clean so is the campus (unless it rains and nothing is in our hand ;p ).
Campus Life
Again this majorly depends on whether you are a boy or a girl. Because for girls there's a daily curfew of 9pm on weekdays and 9:30pm on weekends while for boys in the first year there's curfew of 9pm daily but rest of the years there's no curfew. You'll meet the best people ever if you make the right choices and choose the right group you hangout with. The location of college is the one among the very few setbacks it has because first of all it's in Tiruchirapalli and then it's away from city.
Anything Else
The best feature about tier-1 colleges like top-5 iits,bitsnit Trichy is the Pier group one gets. And here in Nit Trichy there's a wonderful culture of clubs (technical, research, dance, music, astronomy, business you name it) and fests(where everything is planned and organised by the students which develops very important skills one needs for leadership roles in future). Hostel life is Just the best among everything. There's a computer lab too which is accessible 24/7 and has great internet.

33,Life at NIT,"College Infrastructure
NIT gets the points for having technical infrastructure ( labs and equipmentâs ) and a clean campus. Food is like any other college. Hostels ( agate being the worst ) are bad compared to other colleges. Classrooms donât have enough ventilation for all students ( especially after the increase in seats )
Academics
Quality of teaching is subjective...depends on the teacher. But generally, itâs extremely boring compared to my teachers from FIITJEE. Professors, nevertheless, are highly qualified. Curriculum should be the best.
Placements
Everybody gets placed. If theyâre not, theyâre taking up masters or an MBA, sometimes entrepreneurship as well. Salary depends on students. Getting north of 12lpa would be good and a fair share of students get it.
Value-for-money
Ofc. Extremely subsidised ( even expenses in college from canteens ) . Private college students pay atleast twice as much and get way lesser value after graduating. The saved money was used for an Internship in EGYPT for a month. Private : fees NIT : fees + 3 international trips
Campus Life
NIT provides opportunities that make LIFE better. Personally, I hate the campus environment...Iâm more productive by myself at home. Also, thereâs hardly any activity you can do from this city.
Anything Else
Went on a trip/intern to Egypt for a month. More achievements and trips to come.

It was the first step in pursuing my interests. Also, the various college fests of NIT Trichy help us learn team building and organization. In all, the best reasons to study in NIT is because of all the opportunities available in the campus.

53,Love the Infrastructure:,"NIT Trichy boasts of a vast campus with ever-improving infrastructure (new lecture halls, bigger auditoriums, refurbished library, new hostels) to accommodate the increasing number of students. Hostels are just about okay, but fortunately there arenât any problems with water supply at least. First years share their rooms with three other students, second and third year students with one more, while final year students normally have a room to themselves, although that may change a bit due to the increased intake of NIT Trichy. The entire campus will soon be WiFi enabled, but as of now they have huge computer rooms in each hostel which are open 24 hours a day. Specialised internet labs are also available. Students sometimes complain about the ânot so greatâ library, but that promises to improve too very soon.

Also the hostels and messes are clean and very well maintained and any complaints regarding the same are solved at the earliest. Placements is one of the main highlights of this college as it boasts placements on par with many top colleges in the country like IITs.

83,All that glitters,"NIT Trichy boasts of a vast campus with ever-improving infrastructure (new lecture halls, bigger auditoriums, refurbished library, new hostels) to accommodate the increasing number of students. Hostels are just about okay, but fortunately there arenât any problems with water supply at least. First years share their rooms with three other students, second and third year students with one more, while final year students normally have a room to themselves, although that may change a bit due to the increased intake of NIT Trichy. The entire campus is WiFi enabled, but as of now they have huge computer rooms in each hostel which are open 24 hours a day. Specialised internet labs are also available. Students sometimes complain about the ânot so greatâ library, but that promises to improve too very soon.
Hostel life in nit trichy is pretty enjoyable. As all colleges you will have regular exams, but apart from that all the time u can chill. There is curfew for first years but even that is flexible. Rules are stricter for girls, so forget romantic moonlight walk. Overall life is enjoyable. There are good and bad people everywhere, it only depends on who you associate with.
College life is filled with activities around the year. The annual cultural festival ('Festember') , Techno-management festival ('Pragyan') are complemented by department symposiums, inter departmental cultural fests, club activities (which include technical and cultural events). Technical and cultural fests are organised on a very large scale and the entire year is spent on making every edition better than the previous one. Individual hostels, inter-hostels, inter year events are conducted by various clubs, and the hostels themselves. Round the year there are sports events, social and cultural activities, technical competitions, workshops, and lectures (on robotics , computing , etc ).

86,Freedom at its best and a good workspace,"Well constructed hostels, professional professors and a very nice climate to live in. The fee for Casa students is too high and I see that as the only demerit of the college. Good placements and has all necessities inside the campus. The mess food sometimes isn't really worth the paynin terms of taste but has its own quality. If the taste is improvised then it could be better. The college cultural and technical fest is the best part where the students organize, participate and also have fun during it.

88,Unity in Diversity,"In spite of being in the south, my college has a diverse population of students from every part of the country. This builds a very healthy atmosphere for cross cultural interactions and communication. The diverse student crowd in campus also leads to the grand celebrations of almost all the festivals celebrated in India. Meeting people from different cultural backgrounds, working with them and making friends with them is what makes my college life enjoyable. The academics and other facilities provided by the college are more than sufficient to cater our needs. However we have poor hostel facilities and this must be looked into.

89,The perfect place for enthusiasts,"From technical clubs to best cultural teams, best faculty to amazing placements, this college has everything an engineering student needs to equip himself for the competitive world. The college provides various opportunities to enhance our skills from various aspects.  A few drawbacks are the average infrastructural facilities, hostel facilities and curfew for girls. The hostels are old and must be renewed. I feel that NITT, being a college of national importance must remove the curfew for girls which prevents them from using facilities available in campus after 9 PM.

92,A fun filled place,"The place is truly magical. It boasts a multicultural student crowd. The campus is so big that you could probably kill and bury someone and the police will have a tough time finding the body. As expected most of the college is empty or barren. In IIT Madras you have deers and peacocks but in NITT you see exotic animals like cows, dogs and goats. Nevertheless it's the people who make the place truly what it is.

105,Heaven for Opportunists,"Studying here you will get a privilege of studying in ""The Best"" NIT of India (according to MHRD rankings 2016) with much standard facilities companred to all other NITs and a feww IITs too. There a plenty of opportunities for pursuing research either in your branch, or in your out of curriculum interest, which will be very much encouraged from the faculty too. College administration has recently revamped the educational system from batch 2015-2019 onwards which gives flexibility for faculty to conduct exams (Yes, you read it right, faculty and students decide when to have exams rather than an old school model of strict schedule). This flexibility might not be in everyone's interest especially when the faculty decides to keep students romancing with books even in the hostels. 

Placemeny Scenario:-
The placement offers are of well standards in the circuital branches (CSE,ECE,EEE etc.,) as they easily land in jobs where they work on what they have studied in engineering.When the case is of non-circuital branches (Metallurgy, Mechanical,Civil, etc.,) the scenario is very different. Many lamd in jobs which is something which they learn only after joining. But these jobs are the most lucrative ones one can get in NITT and so many people will be willing to get placed in such jobs rather than something related to what they have studied.
College Life inside NIT Trichy:-

1)Hostel and Mess:
Hostels are really good compared to what you see in many other NITs and IITs. The best part (atleast for me :p) is that this college provides you with 4 different cuisines of foods - North Indian cuisine Tamil Nadu cuisine,  Andhra cuisine and Kerala cuisine with options of vegetarian and non-vegetarian foods so that you wont miss home food atleast to some extent.

2) Sports:
NIT Trichy has stadiums dedicated for Basketball, Tennis, Badminton, Cricket and Football. It also has a gym, Swimming Pool, Running track and facilities for many indoor games too. The environment of campus will surely intrigue you to take up some sport activity.

3) Clubs and Campus Fests:
This is where majority of students spend their time in by interest and not by a compelling force of ""Mandatory 75% attendance"". You name a club and NIT Trichy has it :D. Clubs and campus fests are what make your memories memorable in the College Life, and these clubs are so encouraged that the administration even funds and encourages everyone to be a part of some club so that the boy/girl entering the campus leaves as a men/women. And the campus fests are organised by the students with professionality that which I have not seen even in top IITs or other premium colleges of India.

But even after having such splendid facilities no one, except you, can make the best out of NITT and that's why its a heaven for opportunists.

NIT Trichy gives you an exposure which can undoubtedly compared to IITs , and plays a major role in carving out the best in you.

Many symposiums are conducted by the respective departments which have many competitions with rewards, many internships are received through the college, guest lectures are organized during fests like Pragyan, link with PSU like BHEL, Faculties are involved in many corporate projects. Friends and hostel made my college life enjoyable. Currently in 2nd year so no placement offers as of now, Confident to get one. Regular water and electricity supply is provided in the hostel. They should have better communication and explaining skills. Students from every part of India and the world form the student crowd of our institution which justifies the statement ""Unity in Diversity"". The fees are really worth as compared to other premier institutes. Many Scholarships are also provided.

109,Days to remember,"A very good institution with top class faculty members aiding in the academic development of the students.The institute also lays focus upon extra curricular activities as well.Be it sports or college fests,NITT stands a cut above the rest of the institutions.

Also,NITT's alumni are present all around the world,who guide their juniors and support when it comes to placements and internships.NITT also has a long list of distinguished alumni who've made a huge impact in the field of tech as well on the society.

Coming to the life in the campus,students get a lot of opportunities and good platforms to exhibit their skills.The student run clubs and interest groups help the students to improve as well.From non technical clubs like social responsibility,music,dance clubs to technical clubs,students get an opportunity to focus on extra curricular activities as well.

One best thing that you can point out here is that is,the batch of seniors you get.They guide the juniors in the best way possible,and you get to learn a lot from them.

NITT also boasts a wide range of fests that are organized in the campus throughout the calendar year,these fests attract a lot of students from other institutions as well.These also help in the overall development of the students.Moreover,these fests are  completely run by the students entirely,from organizing to marketing,the entire fest is managed by the student community.

All these constitute the student life in the campus and there's much more here to explore!!

110,The best of its kind,"NIT Trichy is the best of all NITs. The overall experience is a one to savour. The research facilities are top notch and the peers are highly competitive. It motivates you to achieve great things personally and professionally. The hostel is a bit difficult to adjust in the earlier days but it wouldn't be a problem after the first six months. The placements have been constantly great the setup for preparation for higher studies is facilitated with many 3rd party coaching centres taking classes and guidance of the professors.

111,Road To be Taken,"In the beginning I was missing home, but after a while I was missing hostel life. The real fun begins when you get to know more people. All those movie nights, hangouts and especially cricket matches. These are moments to reminisce. Moving on to academics, NIT TRICHY is one of the top colleges in India, a tough competitor for the best NIT. Our campus has good facilities and quite a few wonderful professors. Although we don't possess much of industrial knowledge, the students are well versed technically due to their vigourous preparation for JEE. It's very well known to have 100% placement. In the end all I would say is that our Indian curriculum is no where close to the Foreign standards. We have plenty of recreational facilities throughout the campus, but one fact which makes NITT stand out is it's student power, everything in the campus is managed by students from fests to college teams. All so that your journey is worthwhile.

112,Fly high in the Sky,"Student life is really fun here, with friends around. Opportunities that this place provides for students is really very good. Faculty are decent enough, Profs are well versed with the subject and have immense knowledge on the topics they offer.Infrastrure is another very positive thing about this place, it is around 750 square feet and delivers all the basic ammenities for students, it ensures that our travel time is saved by doing this. Mess food is really great, it is not the typical kind of mess they show in the movies, but rather a complete opposite of that and serves our best purpose.Sports facilites in this place are also good,apart from studies they also promote sports which definitely enthusiasts all the students, and they even have sports teams who go to take part in competitions  at different institutions. It also promotes a lot of extra cirricular activities in which students actively take part. It has one of the best cultural festival and one of the greatest technical festival which helps students gain exposure into work fields.Hostel life can best be described by any of us because that's where we spend most of our time cracking jokes and playing, watching movies etc.Curfew times are also reasonable and the campus promotes greenery all around.To sum up, as a student I'm sure I'll take back a lot of good memories from this place.

College life is best enjoyed in NIT Trichy with all the students clubs it fosters.

114,My overall experience was pleasant.,"The campus life is full of ups and downs. Right from not getting potable water to getting interned in the company of your dreams, this college has all that is required for a healthy, and ever lasting 4years of college life. The campus itself is a bit laid back, but it's enormous and becomes quite beautiful during the monsoons. The administration stresses in technological innovation by the students and a large number of clubs are an integral part of the university. College life is not complete without being a part of the three fears that are held and organised by the stidents- Festember, Pragyan and Nittfest.

115,Missed the IITs. Here is NIT Trichy better than some IITs,"First of all as far as the college life is concerned, I would say it is on par with the best IITs given the freedom and ample opportunities that this college provides to its students . The faculty is decent although not excellent ,but there are professors too who actually encourage students to assist them in their research projects . The student fraternity is very diverse as we can see people from all parts of the country present here and hence its aptly called "" Mini India"". The hostels are quite good although mess food needs improvement. As far as placements are concerned it is better than even some of the IITs and of course the best among NITs. On the whole this college definitely transforms an individual in very good ways.

116,"An integration of good education, exposure and talent","NIT has a lot of block catering the need of many operations happening in the college. There are separate buildings for every department. The faculties hold at least a master degree upto a PhD and are very interactive and enthusiastic. The hostel amenities are very good and food is provided on time and the quality is also very good and tasty. Anything and everything can be bought in the campus and the campus offers at most safety to female students. The fee structure is also very nominal. The college has a lot of student clubs which are funded by the institute.

120,NITT - A place to be,"NIT Trichy is one of the oldest colleges in India to provide a PG degree in MBA. The college being one of the oldest and most prestigious, is laden with all sorts of infrastructure (academic and otherwise) one can think of. Equipped with a huge central library along with several departmental libraries, it is heaven for those seeking knowledge via books. Equipped with one of the best computer centers in south India, smart classrooms  and being a WiFi campus, it is a cauldron of the best minds in the country.  The Department of Management Studies organizes frequent guest lectures by eminent personalities, ranging from stalwarts of corporate sectors to academicians, to impart knowledge to the future managers and to put the college on the corporate radar. The students show a great zeal of enthusiasm to participate in various competitions organized by other B-schools and have bagged honours and prizes on a regular basis. DoMS organize a yearly conclave where students get to mix and expand their network as far as corporate connections are concerned. The last year's placement record shows an average placement of INR 6.75 lpa with the highest package offered to be INR 11 lpa. This, while considering the meagre cost of INR 3.6 lakhs (including hostel and mess fees), puts the institute among the top 4 b schools in India in terms of ROI.

121,Best place to spend 4 years after so much hard work for JEE.,"It is indeed a golden opportunity to be in this prestigious institute and pursue your bachelor's. The first we step out of our home and we land in this college is like a dream. The 800-acre campus is so huge that before we could reach the entrance to the college, we can find few department buildings from the highway. The clock tower, the icon of the institute can be seen near the admin block after the entrance. The institute has two massive lecture hall complex where regular classes take place. Each department has its own building where the labs are set up. The computer centre (Octagon) provides internet facilities to the whole campus. There are so many hostels spread across the campus to accommodate all the 5000 odd students. The library is one of the biggest libraries in South Indian colleges. Most important thing is the 24x7 open Cafe Coffee Day outlet which serves freshly brewed coffee at a huge discount. There are other restaurants too inside the campus. Buhari (non-veg), Vasantham (veg and non-veg), Staff canteen (pure veg. note: you get the best coffee here in the campus). There are small shops near few hostels. Roadside Dhabas are there outside the campus which are very busy during the nights.
Recreational facilities are provided in every hostel. Each hostel has a TT room and carrom room. The Sports complex has a GYM, Table tennis room, badminton hall, carrom and chess room. There is tennis court, basket ball court, volleyball court and swimming pool near the sports complex. There is a huge ground for track events and cricket and another ground for football. A small ground is being developed for hockey. There are several smaller grounds near the hostels where students play cricket/football.
The students come from all over the country though there is a 50% reservation for Tamil Nadu students. The girls strength is very less in the campus (8:1 ratio). But it really doesn't matter when it comes to studies or events, they take part very actively and contribute their best. Being amidst diverse people from all parts of the country, we get to know their culture and learn adapt with the cultural differences.
ECE department had the best faulty in the campus (my opinion). To mention a few Dr. Raghavan, Dr. B.Venkataramani, Prof. Bhaskar, Dr. P.Muthuchidambara Nathan have published so many research papers in most leading journals and have attended many international conferences. Dr. B.Venkataramani and Prof. Bhaskar have published a book on Digital Signal Processors which is the only book for that subject.
The fests Festember (Cultural Fest), Pragyan (Techo-Management Fest) are organized by the students. Pragyan is one of the biggest Techo-Management fest in South Asia where lectures by professors from leading universities around the world, workshop by industry experts are organized in the campus. Festember is rated in Top 10 cultural fests in India. All the 4 days of the fest involve various cultural events by the students from various institutes and guest performances by lead bands and performers.
Coming to placements, the institute has 100% placement records over the past few years. Companies like Microsoft, Facebook, Yahoo, Texas Instruments, QualComm, CISCO, nVIDIA do visit the campus and select the best minds in the campus. 
The college fees was very less when compared to any other private college in Chennai. It was 22000 per semester including exam fee, library, internet, etc and hostel fees was 18000 per semester. Availing loan was an easy task with SBI branch inside the campus.

137,Engineering college at its best.,"I expected a lot about this college before I entered it, keeping the IITs in my mind. It is after coming here that I understood that it has its own style and importance and it should not be compared with IITs. You get a lot of exposure to the world here. You spend your college life like a true engineer here. You enjoy a lot through many extra academic activities, a lot many fests: by organising and participating. You explore many new interests in you here. It gives you a chance to choose your career other than engineering. But, common and middle-class people should think twice to opt this college, as one should get prepared to empty one's pockets (but remember: no give, no take). The infrastructure is satisfactory and I hope it gets a lot better in the course of time.
This college gives you an attitude that you can get nowhere else.

208,Incredible NITT,"My college life in this college has been worth treasuring for lifetime. It has provided me with platform and opportunities to grow beyond my imagination into a confident and responsible human being. The infrastructure when i entered in my first year ie in 2012 to what has manifested over 4 years now is a stark contrast. From a no water , no electricity campus with no proper roads to what is now a dream campus with a world class OAT, hostels , AC lecture halls and a own MIG aircraft. Infrastructure of the huge 770 acre campus is marvelous. Faculty, particularly in my department are of high caliber though a little arrogant and stubborn. Overall faculty quality of the college, including new recruits, is not very great but its certainly above any other average college.
Placements are phenomenal. Way better than all NITs and many IITs. There is something called Campus placement training for students in which students are trained to appear for placements. College is very serious and very well structured to handle the placements. In sports and recreational facilities , we have a beautiful swimming pool , a new huge gym , many basketball courts , indoor gym for girls , badminton courts , cricket ground , running track , indoor tennis stadium and what not. The distinguishing feature of this college is the clubs and college fest. The level of autonomy students have here in running the 52+ clubs and south india's biggest college fest is to be seen in no other college. From robotics club , computer club , IoT club to social welfare clubs to music and dance club , you name any field , and there would be an active club in that field. If not , the college administration is very flexible to inaugurate another club. Hostels are good. especially now that all the first year hostels are renovated. There is no power cut , 24 hour water , gyser , washing machine , wifi , etc. The mess food is ok , not great. We do have 3-4 restaurants in campus and also one Cafe Coffee Day. Just one negative thing is that the whether of trichy is very hot , almost throughout the year. Though hostel common rooms and classrooms are now being fitted with ACs, but if you want to go out in city , it can be pretty hot during the daytime.
Overall, this college will provide you with all the opportunities and knowledge source at your disposal, its upto you how you make use of it. I personally have gained alot and am grateful to this college.

Extra curricular focus would give the students an edge over others. The least the students have to focus is on their way placement which would eventually turn out excellent if they equip them self  with the right skills.

212,The life at NIT Trichy,"The hostels at NIT Trichy are fairly decent, but the only problem that I had to encounter was the mess food. Belonging from northern part of the country, the food of mess was almost inedible for me. Not just for the variation of taste but also because if the quality. But apart from this issue that we had to face, life at the campus is enjoyable and placements are great with most of my friends having been placed with reputed organizations.

214,The best days of my life,"This phase of my life was the most beautiful part of my life till now. Here I made a lot of friends who are a family for me till now. Though the facilities were limited and the mess food was horrible , we enjoyed every moment of our life. To having full attendance to not attending even one class per subject, we became a part of the NIT culture. Late night cs games and mafia games which we played are still etched in my memory. In short I would say those were the golden days of my life

215,An excellent place for learning,"The institute doesnât feel like a college. Faculty is good, infrastructure is poor and placements are average. Campus politics is absolutely nil, therefore no problem with respect to violence or tension within the institute. There is no hostel facility available therefore we canât really experience the so-called campus life that everyone boasts about. Facilities like football field or a basketball field are lacking.

218,Standard Institute,"DOMS, is not as NIT is. DOMS is lethargic, industry exposure is NIL, standard of education is almost nothing. ROI as it is known for is not worth it. Standards of the faculty are pathetic. Student Welfare is not a concern for anybody who are a part of DOMS

221,Nitt diaries.,"Started of a bit worried, didn't feel good about feeling my hometown,parents,friends and everything that made me I am today. It was a new start. Orientation courses were very useful helping me to make new friends. Classes started of with a bit intense schedule. But it was manageable. Teaching and the facilities in the college is excellent. So is the mess food which is much better than expected. To sum up, I'm happy and satisfied with where I am.
