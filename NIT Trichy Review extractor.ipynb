There are so many facilities in NIT Trichy, There are so many hostels for boys and girls with various types of rooms. The institution has a modern central library. Our institution also have a sports complex that has all kinds of indoor and outdoor sports. The wifi in our hostel rooms is very fast and there are various food messes for different people and its completely hygienic there.\\nAcademics\\nI opted Instrumentation and Control Engineering shortly termed as ICE here which is basically a Circuital and non-circuital branch, which is also the main reason I opted this course because I can have exposure to both the sectors. This course mainly deals with the controlling of Sensory machines and Jobs like controlling engineer is perfectly suitable. The faculty working here are highly qualified and they teach really great although a bit strict though. the curriculum is perfectly updated here\\nPlacements\\nOur branch has high percentage of placed students from past 7 years. There are many MNC's and startup coming from various sectors and offering various types of jobs through our placement cell. not only my branch every brach has average of 90-95% of placed students and highest is 42 LPA from CSE department. the average salary packages differ for department but in common it will be around 9-12 LPA, The process is so easy for placements cause placement cell will be guiding you and it is supportive\\nValue-for-money\\nAs of first year the fee structure is bit high compared to remaining years So considering all expenses in mind it will be like 1.4 Lakhs in first semester but from them the fees will be like 75-80,000 as I was in my home because of COVID for two years I did'nt need to pay my hostel fee so It is reduced compared to above figures. Off course I feel worth for this money because compared to private Institutions and other NIT's this is relatively less and I have a great campus, excellent education.\\nCampus Life\\nIts really good because college life is best as a teenager and here in NIT-T you have various types of entertaining, technical clubs where you can develop your knowledge and Improve your social skills. There is Pragyan and other cultural fests which are one of the biggest events in India so you'll definitely. The support staff is so polite and helps you in knowing about their local langauge. Yes it is safe because we have hospital in case of emergency and people here also so kind you can be good\\nAnything Else\\nas I almost told everything in the above lines there isn't much to add but this is The best college I can get into in my life cause I overcame my fears with what I have learnt from here and there are many good activities one can do either sports or academical. SO, I would recommend anyone to join in my college if they have a better score in JEE .\\n\\nInfrastructure\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nPlacements\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nAcademics\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nValue for Money\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nCampus Life\"},\n",

       "  'Body': \"College Infrastructure\\nI don't like the campus that much. The reason is it's not well planned. Each building is at a large distance from the other.The campus also lacks greenery.It doesn't have a single green ground. Though the campus has many small halls but doesn't have a single air conditioned auditorium with a capacity of 3000-4000 people. Talking about the classrooms, their are two complexes in which classes happen. But only few rooms have air conditioning facility and rooms in old complex are like that of school\\nAcademics\\nAcademics here are mostly similar to that of Tier-1 college . In the first year syllabus is mostly same irrespective of departments. But you have to study courses that you will feel like useless and are not related to your field. Also the college provieds opportunity to students to do a minor in any course from any department 2nd year onwards. Though almost all the profs are experienced but teaching style of most of them is boring. So the students mostly learn by themselves.\\nPlacements\\nAs I am still in first year, I don't know exact figures about placements but as I have heard,the placements are really good every year with most of students getting placed. Though the percentage of placements is above 85 for all departments, packages do vary. The CSE department students gets high packages in good number as compared to other,followed by ECE. Average package generally goes around 7-8 lpa ,highest being 40-45 lpa.\\nValue-for-money\\nThe fees for a general category student is around 2 lakhs for each year including mess and hostel fees. With decent services being provided, I think it is worth it . The mess and hostel fee is minimal justifying the food quality and hostel premises.\\nCampus Life\\nIt mainly depend on you how you want to enjoy your college life. The college has many extra-curricular and technical societies which regularly participate in national level competition. College also conducts a lot of fests annually , The frontrunner being PRAGYAN and FESTEMBER. The college campus is located on the outskirts,22-23 km from the city , so you are kinda disconnected.

Company.In civil department the highest package was 17 lakh per an um.And the average package is 5lpa.The placement process is easy and the college guides you through the entire process of placement.\\nValue-for-money\\nThe annual tuition fee would be nearly 1,70,000INR irrespective of the department you choose.And it varies year to year.And there is reimbursement of tuition fee whose family annual income is less than 500000 per year. And you will be having many scholarships available after getting into the college.

The laboratories in Mechanical engineering department are filled with several equipment. The hostel WiFi slows down during peak hours most of the times. Otherwise it is just fine. The living places are cleaned up frequently. But they are not as hygienic as they should be. Even the food messes aren't very hygienic.\\nAcademics\\nI'm doing Mechanical engineering because I've been passionate about it since my teenage started. The curriculum needs more update. For eg, in Automobile engineering we still study technology that hasn't been in the industry for the past 10-15 years. We need to know about Electric vehicle technology, Artificial intelligence, etc. But our faculty are forced to move out of curriculum and take extra hours to help us learn these. A lot of efforts outside curriculum are required to make us job-ready.\\nPlacements\\nThe Training and Placement office of NIT Trichy does an excellent job in bringing down several companies for each domain. The procedure is systematic. 90% of the students sitting for placements from mechanical engineering get placed generally. Highest salary package was around 60 lpa to a Computer Science student. Average salary for mechanical engineering companies is 6 lpa. Overall, 10-15 lpa. The process involves a lot of steps and takes a week per company on an average.\\nValue-for-money\\nThe course costs Rs. 99,000 per semester, which is 2 lakhs per year. This includes mess, academic, hostel fees. The expenditure is not so high here. I do feel we are getting our money's worth, when compared to other engineering colleges in India. The competition among the top-notch students helps everyone studying there, pushing us to work hard. The faculty aren't too bad either. Placements are almost guaranteed. The Letters of Recommendation from profs here are totally worth it.\\nCampus Life\\nCampus is huge. It feels to lonely at times due to the forest-y appearance. The best thing here is the presence of around 50 technical clubs and as many non-technical clubs as well. We improve our personality being in college fest teams too. We find no student who doesn't engage in any of them. The location is not good. The campus is 25 km away from the city.

For example, the mechanical branch uses a pretty old building but cse,ece,eee,ice uses new infrastructure. You can enjoy the campus to the fullest but there are certain areas where boys and girls are not allowed respectively. The campus is around 800 acres most of which is unused but the climate of trichy is very humid so sometimes it\\'s hotter than one could expect. The library is huge with almost everything you need.\\nAcademics\\nLike any other college here too there is vagueness in the teaching quality. But it\\'s pretty obvious that one might find mathematics more interesting than environmental science right? Some professors are really good while others are not so good. But once you enter in 2ndsemester here you hardly depend on any professors. And that\\'s a very good thing but you will realise it only when you experience it. The curriculum is not so updated yet but as of now HOD\\'s are trying their best to bring in new cu\\nPlacements\\nI can not emphasize on this more \"placements depends on the quality of students and the work placement committee of your college puts in\". And place-com of nit-trichy is in top-10 in india which includes even the IIMs. Coming to average packages, cse is the Highest with around 20+lpa and overall it\\'s around 7-8lpa. And percentage of students placed too again depends majorly on students themselves because there are around 200 companies visiting the campus every year.\\nValue-for-money\\nThe fees depends upon your category. Like for sc st the tuition fee is totally free. You can check anything related to this on the official website anytime or even on websites like careers360. Coming to the worth of money, the mess food generally is unlimited and it\\'s better than one would expect. I know that\\'s hard to believe but if you choose the right mess you\\'ll get almost home cooked food. The hostels are very clean so is the campus (unless it rains and nothing is in our hand ;p ).\\nCampus Life\\nAgain this majorly depends on whether you are a boy or a girl. Because for girls there\\'s a daily curfew of 9pm on weekdays and 9:30pm on weekends while for boys in the first year there\\'s curfew of 9pm daily but rest of the years there\\'s no curfew. You\\'ll meet the best people ever if you make the right choices and choose the right group you hangout with. The location of college is the one among the very few setbacks it has because first of all it\\'s in Tiruchirapalli and then it\\'s away from city.\\nAnything Else\\nThe best feature about tier-1 colleges like top-5 iits,bitsnit Trichy is the Pier group one gets. And here in Nit Trichy there\\'s a wonderful culture of clubs (technical, research, dance, music, astronomy, business you name it) and fests(where everything is planned and organised by the students which develops very important skills one needs for leadership roles in future).

There a plenty of opportunities for pursuing research either in your branch, or in your out of curriculum interest, which will be very much encouraged from the faculty too. College administration has recently revamped the educational system from batch 2015-2019 onwards which gives flexibility for faculty to conduct exams (Yes, you read it right, faculty and students decide when to have exams rather than an old school model of strict schedule).

Pragyan is one of the biggest Techo-Management fests in South Asia where lectures by professors from leading universities around the world, workshop by industry experts are organized in the campus. Festember is rated in Top 10 cultural fests in India. All the 4 days of the fest involve various cultural events by the students from various institutes and guest performances by lead bands and performers.\\r\\nComing to placements, the institute has 100% placement records over the past few years. Companies like Microsoft, Facebook, Yahoo, Texas Instruments, QualComm, CISCO, nVIDIA do visit the campus and select the best minds in the campus. \\r\\nThe college fees were very less when compared to any other private college in Chennai. It was 22000 per semester including exam fee, library, the internet, etc and hostel fees were 18000 per semester. The availing loan was an easy task with SBI branch inside the campus.\\r\\nOverall it's not just a college.

It has provided me with platform and opportunities to grow beyond my imagination into a confident and responsible human being. The infrastructure when i entered in my first year ie in 2012 to what has manifested over 4 years now is a stark contrast. From a no water , no electricity campus with no proper roads to what is now a dream campus with a world class OAT, hostels , AC lecture halls and a own MIG aircraft. Infrastructure of the huge 770 acre campus is marvelous. Faculty, particularly in my department are of high caliber though a little arrogant and stubborn. Overall faculty quality of the college, including new recruits, is not very great but its certainly above any other average college.\\r\\nPlacements are phenomenal. Way better than all NITs and many IITs. There is something called Campus placement training for students in which students are trained to appear for placements. College is very serious and very well structured to handle the placements. In sports and recreational facilities , we have a beautiful swimming pool , a new huge gym , many basketball courts , indoor gym for girls , badminton courts , cricket ground , running track , indoor tennis stadium and what not. The distinguishing feature of this college is the clubs and college fest. The level of autonomy students have here in running the 52+ clubs and south india's biggest college fest is to be seen in no other college. From robotics club , computer club , IoT club to social welfare clubs to music and dance club , you name any field , and there would be an active club in that field. If not , the college administration is very flexible to inaugurate another club. Hostels are good. especially now that all the first year hostels are renovated. There is no power cut , 24 hour water , gyser , washing machine , wifi , etc. The mess food is ok , not great. We do have 3-4 restaurants in campus and also one Cafe Coffee Day. Just one negative thing is that the whether of trichy is very hot , almost throughout the year. Though hostel common rooms and classrooms are now being fitted with ACs, but if you want to go out in city , it can be pretty hot during the daytime.\\r\\nOverall, this college will provide you with all the opportunities and knowledge source at your disposal, its upto you how you make use of it.
